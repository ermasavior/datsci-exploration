Welcome to HandsOn Week05!

In this week, we will try to implement one of popular 
dimentionality reduction techniques, which is PCA.
To do this, you need to make sure that you already
install these python libraries before class:
   a. numpy
   b. matplotlib
   c. opencv
   d. scikit-learn

Since we will impelement PCA from the scratch 
(from mathematical formula of PCA), make sure
that you also already understand the concept well.
You may take a look to the "PCA_slide.pdf", available
in the course portal.

Last, we will try to use "decision tree" classifier
from scikit-learn. That's very simple one. For those who 
are still not familiar with scikit-learn classifier pipeline,
please learn it before. Again, it's very simple. 

Enjoy~
