Welcome to W06 Handson Week!

In this handson week, we will continue to play about text 
pre-processing to classification problem, especially 
sentiment analysis. Make sure you already install these python
libraries before class:
1. NLTK (just like what we did in W03)
2. scikit-learn
3. numpy
4. pandas

Please download 'w06_handson-materials.zip' before class.
We will give the password in the class.

Enjoy~
